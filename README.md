# Intelligent Course Recommendation Engine

This project is an educational platform that recommends personalized learning paths based on student goals, current skills, and career aspirations. The system uses the Groq API to generate tailored recommendations that adapt to each user's specific needs, with a fallback to local recommendation generation when the backend is unavailable.

## Features

- Personalized course recommendations based on user profile
- Learning material suggestions tailored to career goals
- Skill development priorities with importance ratings
- Structured learning path with phases and milestones
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Offline functionality with mock data when backend is unavailable

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- Internet connection to access the Groq API

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

#### With Backend (Optional)
1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Fill out the form with your information
4. Click "Get Recommendations" to generate personalized learning paths

#### Without Backend (Works Offline)
1. Simply open `index.html` in your browser
2. Fill out the form with your information
3. Click "Get Recommendations" to generate personalized learning paths
4. The application will automatically use mock data if the backend is unavailable

### API Key

The application uses the Groq API for generating recommendations. The API key is already included in the code for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you would want to secure this key using environment variables or a backend service.

## How It Works

1. The user enters their information including current skills, education level, career goals, and learning preferences
2. The application attempts to send this information to the Groq API via the backend server
3. If the backend is available, the Groq API uses a large language model to generate personalized recommendations
4. If the backend is unavailable, the application generates mock recommendations locally based on the user input
5. The recommendations are parsed and displayed in a user-friendly format
6. The user can view their recommended courses, learning materials, skill priorities, and a structured learning path

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and responsive design
- JavaScript for interactivity and API integration
- Groq API for AI-powered recommendations
- Font Awesome for icons

## Example Data

The application is ready to use with any input data. Here's an example you can try:

- **Name**: John Doe
- **Current Skills**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Education Level**: Bachelor's Degree
- **Target Career**: Full Stack Developer
- **Weekly Time Commitment**: 15 hours
- **Preferred Learning Style**: Interactive

## Limitations

- The recommendations generated by the AI model should be reviewed by educational experts for critical learning decisions
- The Groq API-based recommendations require an internet connection and a running backend server
- Mock recommendations (used when backend is unavailable) are less personalized than those from the Groq API
- The Groq API has usage limits that may affect the availability of the service

## Future Improvements

- User accounts to save and track progress
- Integration with actual course platforms for direct enrollment
- Feedback mechanism to improve recommendations over time
- More detailed skill assessments for better personalization
- Enhanced offline recommendation algorithm
- Improved UI with more interactive elements
